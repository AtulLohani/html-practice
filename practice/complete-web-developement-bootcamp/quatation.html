    <p><blockquote cite="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html"> HTML is the foundation of basically every web page. It’s how we tell browsers to structure content into paragraphs, headings, images, links, lists, forms, tables, buttons, and more. If you’re interested in building a website, web development, or just coding in general, learning HTML is a great place to start.

        In this guide to HTML for beginners, we’ll learn what HTML is and what it’s used for. Then, we’ll walk through how to write some basic HTML and review some of its most important elements and attributes. We’ll end with a brief look at some resources you can use to continue learning and using HTML.
        
        Let’s get started.</blockquote></p>
